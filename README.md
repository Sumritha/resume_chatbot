# Resume Builder Chatbot

A simple chatbot application built using Python, Streamlit, and machine learning techniques to help users create and build professional resumes. The bot answers queries related to various sections of a resume, such as personal details, education, skills, internships, projects, and more.

## Features
- **Interactive Chatbot**: The chatbot provides personalized advice on how to build a resume by responding to common questions.
- **Resume Sections**: The chatbot helps you with different sections of the resume, such as personal information, education, skills, experience, projects, and more.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Trained using scikit-learn's `LogisticRegression` with `TfidfVectorizer` to classify user queries into various intents and respond with appropriate tips.

## Requirements

To run the app, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn
- nltk

### Installing the necessary libraries
You can install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install streamlit scikit-learn nltk
How to Run the Application
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/resume-builder-chatbot.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd resume-builder-chatbot
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the app with Streamlit:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
The app will start, and you can open it in your browser at http://localhost:8501.

How It Works
Model Training: The chatbot uses a machine learning model trained with intents and examples of common queries about building resumes. The model is built using LogisticRegression and vectorized text using TfidfVectorizer.
Intents: The chatbot can understand different intents like resume structure, personal information, education, skills, internships, and other resume-related topics.
Chat Interface: The app uses Streamlit to create a simple user interface where you can type your questions, and the bot will respond with useful tips.
Customizing the App
You can customize the app by modifying the intents.json file. Each intent in this file contains examples of questions and responses related to specific resume sections. Add new intents or update the existing ones based on your use case.
