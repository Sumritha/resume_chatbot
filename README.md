### **How It Works**
- **Model Training**: 
  - The chatbot uses a machine learning model trained with intents and examples of common queries about building resumes.
  - The model is built using LogisticRegression and vectorized text using TfidfVectorizer.
- **Intents**: 
  - The bot can understand different intents like resume structure, personal information, education, skills, internships, and other resume-related topics.
- **Chat Interface**: 
  - Built with Streamlit to create a simple user interface where you can type your questions, and the bot responds with helpful tips.

### **Customizing the App**
You can customize the app by modifying the `intents.json` file:
- Each intent in this file contains examples of questions and responses related to specific resume sections.
- Add new intents or update existing ones based on your use case.
